      Inform Africa is currently collaborating with CIPESA on a study on disinformation in Ethiopia. CIPESA and partners are conducting the research in five African countries (Cameroon, Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria, and Uganda), notably around periods of political contestation such as elections and anti-government protests, as well as that related to hate speech.

      The aim is to understand the nature, perpetrators, strategies, and pathways of disinformation, and its effects on democratic actors including civil society, bloggers, government critics, and activists. Further, the project will study the adequacy and effectiveness of remedial measures by platforms, as well as government responses to disinformation. The project will generate evidence to inform multi-stakeholder advocacy for greater transparency and robust action by platforms to minimize harms and to combat disinformation, and proposals on national regulation that fully protects free expression and democratic values while combating what is indisputably harmful content and practices.
